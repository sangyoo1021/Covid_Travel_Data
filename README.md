# Final Project 

## Airline travel and covid-19


## Project Overview
Given the current pandemic ongoing in the world, the team decided to analyze the international airline travel and its correlation with Covid-19. The team will test data points and correlation between Covid-19 cases, vaccine, and number of passengers traveling internationally via airplanes. Additionally, the team is hoping to find a correlation between vaccines and post-pandemic traveling. The team will create a model, train the model, and create predictions for future trends by using the historical values of traveling for the past three years.

## Communication protocols
* Throughout this project, the team used Slack app regulary to communicate with each other.
* The team used Zoom for video calls and screen sharing twice a week.
* The team used Github platform to work together on this project.

## Analysis and Machine Learning 

The team will use Linear Regression and Random Forest Classifier models to analyze the data and store information specific to the dataset. The models will be used to predict future trends of air travel given the historical values of the past three years, by feeding data related to the correlation of Covid-19 cases, vaccines, and air travel. The team decided to use Linear Regression because it is efficient to train and easy to implement and interpret. Additionally, the team chose Random Forest Classifier becuase they can handle thousands of input variable without variable deletion and run efficiently on large datasets.
